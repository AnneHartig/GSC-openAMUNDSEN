# GSC-openAMUNDSEN
Data and scripts used to process GSC with the openAMUNDSEN model in the thesis: "A COMPARISON OF GLACIER SURFACE CLASSES FROM MODEL SIMULATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING - A CASE STUDY FROM THE ÖTZTAL ALPS"

# Data included in this repository contains the following: 

- rofental.yml: contains configuration file for the model setup for the catchment Ötztal Alps, Austria, spatial resolutions 50 m, using meteorological data from 09/2013 to 09/2021.
- rofental.py: initialization file for the openAMUNDSEN model run including ice initialization 
  
- XAYYRAY PLOTS.ipynb: jupyter notebook containing the main script for the processing of the model results 
- ENVEO.ipynb: jupyter notebook containing the main script for the processing of the satellite derived GSC data
- JOINED PLOTS.ipynb: jupyter notebook containing the script for the processing of the model data in combination with the satellite derived GSC data
- snowline.ipynb: jupyter notebook containing the script for the processing of the SLA from both GSC datasets
