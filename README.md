# GSC-openAMUNDSEN
Data and scripts used to process GSC with the openAMUNDSEN model in the thesis: "Glacier surface melt processes in the Ötzal Alps -  A comparison of glacier surface classes (GSC) from the openAMUNDSEN Model and remote sensing data"

# Data included in this folder contains the following: 

- openamundsen-examples-main.zip: contains the Model setup, including ice and firn initialization for the research catchment Rofental (Ötztal Alps, Austria), spatial      resolutions 50 and 100 m, meteorological and validation data from 09/2013 to 08/2023.
        + configurationfile:   rofental.yml
        + initializationfile:  rofental.py
        + all input data used
